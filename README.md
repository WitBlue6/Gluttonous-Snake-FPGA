# Gluttonous Snake Mini Game in FPGA

## 1.Introduction  

This repository contains my project in a course, which is trying to accomplish a mini game with VGA in FPGA. I chose Gluttonous Snake and it may be changed in the future.

## 2.Environment

The project is built on Vivado 2023.2. There is no IP core used so it's easy to be ported.

## 3.Demo

* Now the red snake can eat the score by pushing bottom to touch it.

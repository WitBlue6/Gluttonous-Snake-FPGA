# Gluttonous Snake Mini Game in FPGA

## 1.Introduction  

This repository contains my project in a course, which accomplished a mini game named Gluttonous Snake with VGA in FPGA.  
The Snake Game has achieved almost all modules and they are shown below.

## 2.Environment

The project is built on Vivado 2022.2 and it's running in EGO1 Board. There is no IP core used so it's easy to be ported.
